      "\n",
      "Often, parallel workflow is described in terms of a [Directed Acyclic\n",
      "Graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) or DAG. A\n",
      "popular library for working with Graphs is\n",

      "## Why are DAGs good for task dependencies?\n",
      "\n",
      "The 'G' in DAG is 'Graph'. A Graph is a collection of **nodes** and\n",
      "**edges** that connect the nodes. For our purposes, each node would be a\n",
      "task, and each edge would be a dependency. The 'D' in DAG stands for\n",
      "'Directed'. This means that each edge has a direction associated with\n",
      "it. So we can interpret the edge (a,b) as meaning that b depends on a,\n",
      "whereas the edge (b,a) would mean a depends on b. The 'A' is 'Acyclic',\n",
      "meaning that there must not be any closed loops in the graph. This is\n",
      "important for dependencies, because if a loop were closed, then a task\n",
      "could ultimately depend on itself, and never be able to run. If your\n",
      "workflow can be described as a DAG, then it is impossible for your\n",
      "dependencies to cause a deadlock.\n",
